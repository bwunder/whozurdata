One day a boy found a better way to do his task. The next day he found an even better way. And on it 
went until one day the young man realized he had found a way to find better ways. Soon he was sharing 
his discovery. Now many people were finding better ways. Some better ways were so different from the 
old way that much had to change in order to do things the better way. And sometimes the best way to do 
things turned out to be going back to the old way. This became a burden for everyone. People grew unhappy 
about trying to find a way to make the changes needed in order to change so many things for the better 
each time the old man would find a new way to find better ways. The tired old hack struggled with this 
but finally realized that finding better ways is seldom best. The best way to do anything is as 
well as you are able the first time. Sometimes you can fix it, but don't even try to fix failure. Sometimes 
it is better to scrap it all and start again while there is still time.

This calls for the worlds first inter-model multi-master data replicator/query router with nodejs
administrative UI and CSS-like translation sheets to define JSON-to-[some_data_store] query mapping rules.  
The unique idea is that the application always speaks through the cache object. Changes to this cache 
propagate to stores through event callbacks to handlers that apply the translation sheet rules.

<p>
translation sheet example?

Data Routes are run time pathways from the application to storage. If you visualize the intersection of data 
moving between ap and storage in the MVC pattern and also in the 3 tier architecture (with client, server 
and data layers), the two orbs of abstraction will intersect across an arc. To me this is an image of an 
out of phase double helix (the fact that it is also UV in my imagination is irrelevant for this discussion). 
But it is also incomplete. Niether abstraction fairly allows the possibilities that: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>all data does not come from a single data source</li>
<li>one query request need not always be fulfilled by one query engine</li>
</ol>
